## How to Use

### Adding a Task

1. Click the purple **"Add New Task"** button
2. Fill in the task name
3. Add a description explaining what needs to be done
4. Choose a **Category** (Art, Code, Audio, Design, Docs, Marketing, Infra, Other)
5. Set the **Priority** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
6. Click **"Add Task"**

### Viewing Tasks

- **Pending tab** - Tasks that still need to be done
- **Completed tab** - Tasks that are done but need review/verification
- **Implemented tab** - Archived tasks (auto-deleted after 7 days)
- **Filter buttons** - Click any category to filter the list

### Task Workflow

Tasks flow through three stages: **Pending → Completed → Implemented**

1. Click on a task card to open details
2. Use **"Mark Completed"** when work is done
3. Use **"Mark Implemented"** to archive (auto-deletes in 7 days)
4. Use **"Back to..."** buttons if you need to revert a task

### Deleting a Task

Click the **X** on any task card.
